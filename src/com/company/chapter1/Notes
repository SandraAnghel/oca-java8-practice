Class = basic building block
Object = runtime instance of a class in memory
State(state of a program) = the collection of objects at runtime
Keyword = a word with a special meaning( e.g. class, public, static etc)
Method = an operation that can be called(executed)
Method Signature = full declaration of a method
JVM = java virtual machine
    - JVM calls underlying system to:
            - allocate memory
            - allocate CPU
            - access files etc.
Package = similar with a folder
        = used by java to logically group classes
java.lang = special package because it is automatically imported

Java has a default constructor if the class doesn't contain an explicit constructor defined
